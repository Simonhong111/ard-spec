# Analysis Ready Data (ARD) Specification

This repository is a draft set of recomendations for describing ARD in a standardized way to faciliate the discovery and use of geospatial datasets by a variety of end users.

This effort arose out of a working group convened at the [ARD19 Workshop](https://www.ard.zone/ard19) and is very much a work in progress.
